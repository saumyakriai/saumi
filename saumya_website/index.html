                    Developed an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to enhance resume content and streamline the job application process using natural language processing techniques.
                    This project demonstrates the integration of NLP models and automation to improve HR processes, making it easier for companies to identify top talent and manage large volumes of job applications efficiently.
